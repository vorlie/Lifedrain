# **LifeDrain**

**LifeDrain** adds a simple but powerful mechanic to Minecraft: stealing life from hostile mobs. Every time you attack, you’ll heal yourself based on the damage dealt, making combat a way to stay alive rather than just survive.

🩸 **Features:**
- **Healing mechanics:**
    - Base healing scales with the difficulty level:
        - Easy: 2.0 HP
        - Normal: 1.0 HP
        - Hard: 0.5 HP
    - Bonus healing based on the damage dealt: 20% of the damage dealt.
    - Lifesteal cooldown is set to 1000 milliseconds (1 second) by default.
- **Client-Side Features:**
    - **Particle Effects:** Enable or disable particle effects when healing is triggered. Particles are client-side, meaning they will only be visible on your screen.
    - **Client-Side Configuration Options:** Through **Cloth Config** and **Mod Menu**, you can customize particle effects, cooldown settings, and other features directly from the in-game settings menu.
- Applies only to hostile mobs, ensuring lifesteal is balanced and works as intended in combat.

⚙️ **Configuration:**
- Customize healing values for different difficulty levels:
    - Base healing for Easy, Normal, and Hard modes.
    - Bonus healing multiplier based on the damage dealt.
- **Client-Side Customization:**
    - Enable or disable particle effects when healing is triggered (client-side only).
    - Adjust the cooldown for lifesteal activation (time between consecutive lifesteal uses).
    - Configuration options are accessible through **Cloth Config** and **Mod Menu**.
- All settings are saved to `lifedrain.json` and can be modified directly.
- The config file is automatically updated to add missing values if they are not found.
- Use the `/check_config` command to automatically check and update the config file if necessary.
